### Note on documentation

This documentation has been generated using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/), and is thus in constant change. Documentation is generated through in-code XML commenting. If there is missing documentation, then the in-code commenting has not yet been done or published. If there is an issue, or you require information that is not yet documented, please submit a new [feature request](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/MupenSharp/issues) on the GitHub repository.
